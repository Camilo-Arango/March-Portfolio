The goal of this assignment was to create a professional portfolio to showcase my skills and projects that I have worked on throughout the course.

Most of the portfolio is formatted using HTML and CSS, but I used a little bit of JS to make sure the navbar sticks to the top of the page and persists while scrolling.
